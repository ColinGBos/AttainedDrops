Please do! I am very much in favour of people helping me out, whether it be fixing
what mistakes I have made, new textures or even new features (may not pull everything).

If you wish to clone the repository please ensure that you adhere to the 
code preferences provided in the preference xml.

Run gradle setupDecompWorkspace or gradle setupDevWorkspace in the root directory
Follow by running gradle eclipse - or idea presuming it is still possible
to import the preferences xml...

Enjoy!
